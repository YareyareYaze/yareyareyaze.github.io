Eon Rangers is a co-op puzzle platformer that revolves around 2 characters with different powers. 

<br>One is able to shoot a projectile at the other player to propel them upwards while the other has the ability to teleport the other player away. 

<br>This game was made with the theme of “Friendship”.

<br>This was a game my team of 4 developed that achieved 2nd place at the JamesCook University 2016 Retro Inspired Game Jam.

<br>I was in charge of the level design for this game.
