Cewlwars is a tug of war game that focuses on Bulls versus Bears, as per the theme given to us during the game jam. The game ends when one side manages to overpower the other and destroy the opposing base.

<br>This game was created by my team at the 2015 DBS Game Jam during my time at Temasek Polytechnic.
