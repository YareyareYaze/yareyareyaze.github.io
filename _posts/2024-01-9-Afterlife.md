Afterlife is a top down RTS set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with zombies. 

<br>In the world of Afterlife, the game takes place after a zombie virus outbreak. What was thought to be a revolutionary drug that would change the medicinal field, backfired horrendously resulting in the walking dead. 

<br>In this zombie-infested world, you play as a group of survivors fighting their way towards a rumored safe zone.

<br>This game was developed by my team during our 2nd year at DigiPen, in the Software Engineering Project module accross 2 semesters.
