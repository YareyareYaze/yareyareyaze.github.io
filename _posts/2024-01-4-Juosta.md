JUOSTA (meaning run in Finnish) is a 2D rouge-lite top-down bullet hell shooter set around the Norse Mythology and viking theme. The objective of the game is to escape to the final floor of the dungeon by traversing through the procedurally generated rooms filled with monsters and random events that would alter each playthrough. 

<br>The game also features a unique combat system that revolves around hitting monsterâ€™s vital points on top of an upgrade, lifeline and ultimate system that rewards skilled players while also providing a safety net for beginners.

<br>This game was developed by my team during our 1st year at DigiPen, in the Software Engineering Project module
