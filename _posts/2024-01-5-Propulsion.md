Propulsion is a puzzle platformer that revolves around the propulsion gun given to the player. The game features numerous levels for the player to enjoy, all of which are based around the propulsion gun. 

<br>As per the name of the gun, the propulsion gun allows the player to propel themselves around the level, only being able to access the next level by reaching the end of the current one.

<br>This game was made by my team at an in-house game jam orgranised by my course at Temasek Polytechnic
